# T5 Translation: English to French 

This repository contains a notebook that fine-tunes a T5 model for English-to-French translation using Hugging Face libraries. It is part of a practical exercise from the official [Hugging Face LLM Course]([https://huggingface.co/course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1?fw=pt)).

##  Task Overview

The objective of this project is to fine-tune a pre-trained T5 Transformer model (`google-t5/t5-small`) on a translation dataset to learn how to translate English text into French.

This work was completed as an exercise from the Hugging Face Course, under the chapter on **Transforemers models**.
